            <h1>Chandrayaan-3</h1>
            <p>Chandrayaan-3 is a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-2 to demonstrate end-to-end capability in safe
                landing and roving on the lunar surface. It consists of Lander and Rover configuration. It will be 
                launched by LVM3 from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota. The propulsion module will carry the lander and rover 
                configuration till 100 km lunar orbit. The propulsion module has Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet 
                Earth (SHAPE) payload to study the spectral and Polari metric measurements of Earth from the lunar orbit.

                Chandrayaan-3 consists of an indigenous Lander module (LM), Propulsion module (PM) and a Rover with an objective
                of developing and demonstrating new technologies required for Inter planetary missions. The Lander will have the 
                capability to soft land at a specified lunar site and deploy the Rover which will carry out in-situ chemical analysis 
                of the lunar surface during the course of its mobility. The Lander and the Rover have scientific payloads to carry out 
                experiments on the lunar surface. The main function of PM is to carry the LM from launch vehicle injection till final 
                lunar 100 km circular polar orbit and separate the LM from PM. Apart from this, the Propulsion Module also has one 
                scientific payload as a value addition which will be operated post separation of Lander Module. The launcher identified 
                for Chandrayaan-3 is GSLV-Mk3 which will place the integrated module in an Elliptic Parking Orbit (EPO) of size ~170 x 36500 km.

                The mission objectives of Chandrayaan-3 are:
                <br/>
            1. To demonstrate Safe and Soft Landing on Lunar Surface <br/>
            2. To demonstrate Rover roving on the moon and <br/>
            3. To conduct in-situ scientific experiments.

                To achieve the mission objectives, several advanced technologies are present in Lander such as,

                1. Altimeters: Laser & RF based Altimeters
                2. Velocimeters: Laser Doppler Velocimeter & Lander Horizontal Velocity Camera
                3. Inertial Measurement: Laser Gyro based Inertial referencing and Accelerometer package
                4. Propulsion System: 800N Throttleable Liquid Engines, 58N attitude thrusters & Throttleable Engine Control Electronics
                5. Navigation, Guidance & Control (NGC): Powered Descent Trajectory design and associate software elements
                6. Hazard Detection and Avoidance: Lander Hazard Detection & Avoidance Camera and Processing Algorithm
                7. Landing Leg Mechanism.
