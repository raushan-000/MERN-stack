        <h1>Chandrayaan-3</h1>
        <!-- Inline CSS -->
        <p style="background-color: blueviolet;">Chandrayaan-3 is a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-2 to demonstrate end-to-end capability in safe
            landing and roving on the lunar surface. It consists of Lander and Rover configuration. It will be 
            launched by LVM3 from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota. The propulsion module will carry the lander and rover 
            configuration till 100 km lunar orbit. The propulsion module has Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet 
            Earth (SHAPE) payload to study the spectral and Polari metric measurements of Earth from the lunar orbit.
        </p>
        <p style="color: brown;">
            Chandrayaan-3 consists of an indigenous Lander module (LM), Propulsion module (PM) and a Rover with an objective
             of developing and demonstrating new technologies required for Inter planetary missions. The Lander will have the 
             capability to soft land at a specified lunar site and deploy the Rover which will carry out in-situ chemical analysis 
             of the lunar surface during the course of its mobility. The Lander and the Rover have scientific payloads to carry out 
             experiments on the lunar surface. The main function of PM is to carry the LM from launch vehicle injection till final 
             lunar 100 km circular polar orbit and separate the LM from PM. Apart from this, the Propulsion Module also has one 
             scientific payload as a value addition which will be operated post separation of Lander Module. The launcher identified 
             for Chandrayaan-3 is GSLV-Mk3 which will place the integrated module in an Elliptic Parking Orbit (EPO) of size ~170 x 36500 km.

            The mission objectives of Chandrayaan-3 are:
            <br/>
           1. To demonstrate Safe and Soft Landing on Lunar Surface <br/>
           2. To demonstrate Rover roving on the moon and <br/>
           3. To conduct in-situ scientific experiments.
